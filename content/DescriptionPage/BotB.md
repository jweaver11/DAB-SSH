  ### Game Overview:
BotB is a battle-card strategy game that combines choice-driven 
narrative features and programmed charitable impact. All in-game 
transactions are visible throughout the two-week experience,
ensuring complete transparency for the players. The game's smart 
contracts guarantee a higher reward, unique to the NFT space: 
programmatically-assured charitable impact. Winning gamers will
have the option to share their "spoils" with Disabled American Veterans (DAV)
for further impact. Charitable giving on the blockchain offers the promise 
of complete transparency. 

DAB has guaranteed that promise by disallowing human intervention in 
BotB's contract-cemented code. The game's strict parameters and automated 
controls circumvent "trust-based" agreements, which are vulnerable 
to human error, greed, or changeability. BotB self-monitors by way 
of a system built on total transparency.

BotB's core objective is to do great while doing great. It challenges the 
existing NFT gaming community, the crypto-curious, and even the most skeptical 
crypto critics to get involved. Players will be empowered, entertained, and 
educated while supporting a truly deserving cause.

  ### Gameplay:
In BotB, "Cards" or “player game pieces” are NFTs, and their value appreciates
the more the game is played. 
Buccaneers in BotB have three categories of stats: physical, mental, and spiritual, and 
belong to one of three classes (human, cyborg, and robot), each starting out with 
the same stats for the 1st iteration. Battles are initiated by any player at any time. 
The game also features a defense mode that grants players an increased chance of
winning if they are attacked. Interactive elements and battle outcomes are 
determined by the game's programming and informed by player choices. All actions carry 
a small cost, and the game continuously distributes these amounts to its three main pools: 
DAV, the treasure chest (prize), and DAB (BotB's team).
