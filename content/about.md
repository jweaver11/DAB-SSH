## Let’s talk about artichokes

The _artichoke_ is mentioned as a garden plant in the 8th century BC by Homer
**and** Hesiod. The naturally occurring variant of the artichoke, the cardoon,
which is native to the Mediterranean area, also has records of use as a food
among the ancient Greeks and Romans. Pliny the Elder mentioned growing of
_carduus_ in Carthage and Cordoba.

> He holds him with a skinny hand,
> ‘There was a ship,’ quoth he.
> ‘Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!’
> An artichoke, dropt he.

--Samuel Taylor Coleridge, [The Rime of the Ancient Mariner][rime]

## Mission:

Digital Art Brokers _DAB_ is a blockchain and NFT gamification company dedicated to creating
unique gaming experiences while giving back through charitable partnerships.
Buccaneers of the Blockchain (BotB) is DAB's first project, created in partnership with the national
nonprofit organization DAV (Disabled American Veterans). BotB is a crypto-based game that allows
players to learn the basics of blockchain gaming and engage in a transparent support system for
disabled veterans – all while competing to earn real money.
BotB is the first piece of a larger project aiming to illustrate DAB’s gamified model of service that
re-imagines the donor/recipient relationship. DAB has plans to offer a host of experiences to offer
another space where community-building and Web3 experience(s) can expand.
DAB is committed to transparency, charitable impact, and providing unique gaming experiences.
DAB’s ultimate objective is to utilize Web3, NFTs, and blockchain-based technologies to provide
community value and initiate participation. Achievement of this will be satisfied by coding
service into its tech, re-imagining “traditional” models of charitable giving, and
re-conceptualizing the donor/recipient paradigm.
BotB's partnership with DAV is an example of DAB's mission to do great while doing great. Players
can enjoy a fun and competitive gaming experience while contributing to a worthy cause.

## Partnership with DAV:

    DAV empowers veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. It is dedicated to a single
purpose: keeping our promise to America's veterans. DAV ensures that veterans and their families
can access the full range of benefits available to them, fights for the interests of America's injured
heroes on Capitol Hill, provides employment resources to veterans and their families, and educates
the public about the great sacrifices and needs of veterans transitioning back to civilian life.
DAB has committed 25% (from mint) & 40% (of in-game purchases) of all BotB revenues to DAV, and
any action performed within the game will result in further contribution. DAV CEO Mark Burgess is
thrilled to partner with a great start-up company like DAB.

DAB Head Developer Josh Ferguson has stated that bringing the DAV's purpose forward and into
the blockchain space would demonstrate the far-reaching potential of the blockchain to support
DAV in a wildly new and meaningful way – adding that he and the team anticipate great things to
come.
