## Mission:                                                              
                                                                         
Digital Art Brokers (DAB) is a blockchain and NFT                        
gamification company dedicated to creating unique                        
gaming experiences while giving back through                             
charitable partnerships.                                                 
                                                                         
Buccaneers of the Blockchain (BotB) is DAB's first project,              
created in partnership with the national nonprofit                       
organization DAV (Disabled American Veterans).                           
BotB is a crypto-based game that allows players to learn                 
the basics of blockchain gaming and engage in a transparent              
support system for disabled veterans – all while competing               
to earn real money. BotB is the first piece of a larger project          
aiming to illustrate DAB’s gamified model of service that re-imagines    
the donor/recipient relationship.                                        
                                                                         
DAB has plans to offer a host of experiences to offer                    
another space where community-building and Web3 experience(s)            
can expand. DAB is committed to transparency, charitable impact,         
and providing unique gaming experiences. DAB’s ultimate objective        
is to utilize Web3, NFTs, and blockchain-based technologies              
to provide community value and initiate participation.                   
                                                                         
Achievement of this will be satisfied by coding service into its tech,   
re-imagining “traditional” models of charitable giving, and              
re-conceptualizing the donor/recipient paradigm. BotB's partnership      
with DAV is an example of DAB's mission to do great while doing great.   
Players can enjoy a fun and competitive gaming experience while          
contributing to a worthy cause.                                          

## Partnership with DAV:

Disabled American Veterans (DAV) empowers veterans to lead high-quality 
lives with respect and dignity. It is dedicated to a single purpose: 
keeping our promise to America's veterans. DAV ensures that veterans 
and their families can access the full range of benefits available to them, 
fights for the interests of America's injured heroes on Capitol Hill, 
provides employment resources to veterans and their families, and educates
the public about the great sacrifices and needs of veterans transitioning 
back to civilian life.

DAB has committed 25% (from mint) & 40% (of in-game purchases) of all BotB 
revenues to DAV, and any action performed within the game will result in 
further contribution. DAV CEO Mark Burgess is thrilled to partner with a 
great start-up company like DAB.

DAB Head Developer Josh Ferguson has stated that bringing the DAV's purpose 
forward and into the blockchain space would demonstrate the far-reaching 
potential of the blockchain to support DAV in a wildly new and meaningful 
way – adding that he and the team anticipate great things to come.
